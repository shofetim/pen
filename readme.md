# This is Pen a simple markup system a la Scribe and Scribble


## Goals

- Small, self contained binary that is easy to install.
- Uses @ syntax.
  - Use @{} to wrap content that should be interpreted by pen.
  - Use @[] or @`` to pass raw, un-pen parsed text.
- To output a @ use @verbatim[@].
- HTML is the _sole_ target output.
- Optionally produce Janet data structures as an intermediate form.
- Ability to create a single page document (i.e. embed CSS). Which can be
  overridden with a supplied style sheet.
- Has a decent default appearance.
- No extension â€” just modify it to add more tags. All that is needed to add a
  new tag is to add it to env.janet. Call it as needed.
- Default tags include @pikchr.
- No html tag prefix.


## To-dos
